                <p>Madeon made a surprise appearance during ISOxo's day 1 set of him and Knock2's multi-day series of Shows at LA's Shrine venue. 
                    Madeon stayed on stage and celebrated during ISOxo's remix of his song Icarus. Followers of both ISOxo and Madeon will remember 
                    Madeon bringing ISOxo onstage during one of his DJ sets in Miami earlier in may. The continued friendship of the two artists 
                    has fans asking whether a collaboration between the two could be a possibility down the line.

                <h2>BREAKING: Fan recieves rare imperial pendant at Good Faith Forever at The Shrine.</h2>  
                <h3><i>Nov 17, 2023</i></h3>
                <p>An anonymous Madeon fan recieved one of the elusive imperial pendants during a never seen before "ritual" on stage during Good Faith Forever 
                    at The Shrine. The fan was selected after taking part in a brief ARG that started with a teaser at the Red Rocks show. The pendants, which were 
                    revealed to the world all the way back in mid-2019, were originally concieved to be found by Madeon fans worldwide, but were never able to be located by fans. 
                    This is the first known time that anyone who is not Madeon or one of his associates has ever been in possession of a pendant. The "ritual" 
                    for passing on the pendant at the final Good Faith Forever show may be symbolic for the end of the Good Faith Era.

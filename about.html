                <h2>Who are we?</h2> 
                <p>The Architects Blog is a project dedicated to reporting on news and celebrating the work of French electronic musician 
                    Hugo Leclerq, also known as Madeon. The blog was started by Kennesaw State University student David Rice, who has been a Madeon fan 
                for 5+ years. We report on the latest updates regarding Madeon's creative work, provide a timeline of Madeon's projects, and offer 
            a gallery of Madeon and his work.</p>

                    and has been producing music and uploading it to the internet since he was just 12 years old. He first found widespread fame

                    Since his debut into the wider electronic scene, Madeon has released two studio albums:
